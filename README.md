# CP Field Links v. 1.2.2 for Craft CMS ![Craft 2.5](https://img.shields.io/badge/craft-2.5-red.svg?style=flat-square)

CP Field Links is a tiny utility plugin making content modelling a little bit easier in Craft.  

Did you forget a field handle? Mouse over the cogwheel next to the field title, and CP Field Links will tell you.  

Need to adjust some field settings? Click the cogwheel; CP Field Links will redirect you to the relevant field's settings page – and back to the content when you're done.  

Additionally, CP Field Links will add a link in your element edit forms to manage source settings (e.g. entry type, category group) in the same manner.  

Note that CP Field Links will only be active for **admin** users.  

**Looking for the Craft 3 version?**  
CP Field Links is available for Craft 3 (it has been renamed, though) – visit the [CP Field Inspect](https://github.com/mmikkel/CpFieldInspect-Craft) repo.  

**Recent updates**  
* Now working inside Live Preview, Matrix and Element Editor modals
* Full Craft Commerce support (including variants)

## Disclaimer

This plugin is totally free, and you can do whatever you want with it (and to it). CP Field Links is unlikely to mess up your stuff, but if it does, the author takes absolutely no responsibility.
